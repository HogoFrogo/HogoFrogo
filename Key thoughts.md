## Game nature
    May/Could/Should be an intuitive game.
    Not a big project probably, just to try to create some game cooperatively.
## Gameplay style
    Platform fighting game (e. g. Smash Bros) with an emphasis on controls, that impersonate frog behaviour (hold A+S to wind up, release to jump in the left direction, hold K+L and release for the other direction).
## Story basis
    The catch is that you are a frog pet that after the final bossfight is returned to the terrarium -> epilogue - you return the sandwich to the sadfrog - image zooms out and you see the whole yard (all the levels). we will build on this basis.
