## Story
The point of the story and the game itself is an upbeat optimistic and funny motive. The levels and enemies are varying in themes to fulfill a comedic, but overally happy atmosphere.
### Intro
Once upon a time there was a small town frog named Mr. Croak. Mr. Croak was just a kid when he felt the need to explore the new lands he heard about so much. His friend, Sad Frog, liked this idea and proposed they go out on a field trip. They were so excited about the journey, they even packed up lunch. Sadly, a while after embarking on their journey, Sad Frog froze. He started looking around in panic and started sweating profusely. Before Mr. Croak could ask him about the issue, he bolted off. Our small town frog friend has therefore decided to follow him.

### Zeroth level
Mood: A little bit funny, supposed to catch the attention, entertain, beautify the clich√© of tutorials.
#### On the path to Sad Frog
Mr. Croak: What has gotten into him? I must 
A pretty safe area with scarce amount of enemies. Player is directed to learn basic movement controls and just get used to them and reach the end of level where sad frog is waiting.
Dialog:  
P: Hello there! I'm <player_name>!  
N: Hello <player_name>! :(  
P: What's going on?  
N: My wife has prepared me my favourite salami sandwich for snack but evil flies have taken the control over it!  
P: Why don't you eat them?  
N: I'm allergic to flies! :(  
N: Could you help me save my sandwich?  
P: (a) Of course! (b) Of course!  

### First level
Mood: Curious, Adventurous
#### Saving The Sandwich
Player arrives at the map and gets coltrols help with tongue stick out. He jumps around till he arrives near the sandwich where bunch of flies are flying around it. When he kills them The Fly King arrives and throws poop all around. Player has to beat him to finish the level. After finish he goes back to return the sandwich.

### Second level
Mood: Time is on the clock, Thrilling, Chase-y
Chase level - tsunami, if you are not fast enough, sandwich will be soaked - game over
On the way back a tsunami wave arrives by some kid that jumps into a puddle (maybe just by a joy and splash sound in the backgroud). Player needs to jump as far from the wave as he can. The wave is fast.

Cutscene  
After the escape a night begins 

### Third level
Mood: Gloomy, Mysterious
Night Level - limited vision (circle around the player, that gets smaller) - when a player eats a firefly, the light radius expands -> night boss (either he does the 'lights out' and is visible only by a small light everytime you reach an HP threshold or he makes the darkness and you can't enter it)
At the end of the day the chase is over and player arrives in a frog hood made partly from small plastic toy soldiers in the background. Frogs have weapons and cars. At the end of the hood a frog with big cigar is sitting and smoking... Snoop Frogg. Player smokes cigar with him or not.

### Fourth level
Mood: Gangsta, Cocky, Dope
frog hood - car level - two sections - bottom (flat level where the car goes) upper (with enemies on platforms that want to destroy the car) - when player jumps out, car stops until he gets back in
In both cases (smoking, non smoking) the player wakes up without sandwich. Player needs to beat the hood to get the sandwich or get out. At the end of the level player gets sunglasses and a car from hood frogs and he puts the sunglasses on and drives out with yellowish filter over screen.
After confronting the gangsters they retrieve the sandwich, but they are low on gas, so they postpone the shared lunch so Mr. Croak can search for the gas station.

### Fifth level
Mood: Mexican, Thirsty, Desolate but not Lost
desert level - hydration mechanic that sets up max jump limit according to the hydration meter (the lower it is, the lower you jump)
when gettign to the end of the level to refuel the car, Sad Frog pulls on an Olgoj Chorchoj tail instead of the hose - Olgoj gets mad and starts a boss fight
Level with yellowish filter over screen player arrives in a (mexican-like?) desert.

### Sixth level
Mood: Boss fight, Epic
when starting the level, environment looks like the zeroth level. Mr. Croak wonders why it looks similar to their starting place, while wondering about the similarity the frog friends hear
test of the player's abilities - button (timed) sequence, jump puzzle, tongue mechanics - former biom seen in 0. level - HUMAN BOSS (child's father) - climb the human, environmental damage (hands) - different body sections, different gameplay gimmicks - final 'head' level - lick the eyes multiple times to kill it

Epilogue mood: Relieved, Victorious, Homecoming
