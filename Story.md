## Story
### Intro
Once upon a time there was a little frog named <player_name> that wanted to help the other frog to be happy. It heard about a very sad frog so it decided to go straight to it to help and make it happy.

### Zeroth level
#### The Journey To Help The World
Empty level without any enemies. Player is directed to learn basic movement controls and just get used to them and reach the end of level where sad frog is waiting.
Player arrives in an empty level with controls help to learn basic movement. When he arrives at the end of map he meets a sad black rain frog.  
Dialog:  
P: Hello there! I'm <player_name>!  
N: Hello <player_name>! :(  
P: What's going on?  
N: My wife has prepared me my favourite salami sandwich for snack but evil flies have taken the control over it!  
P: Why don't you eat them?  
N: I'm allergic to flies! :(  
N: Could you help me save my sandwich?  
P: (a) Of course! (b) Of course!  

### First level
#### Saving The Salami Sandwich
Player arrives at the map and gets coltrols help with tongue stick out. He jumps around till he arrives near the sandwich where bunch of flies are flying around it.

After the escape a night begins 

### Third level
Night Level - limited vision (circle around the player, that gets smaller) - when a player eats a firefly, the light radius expands -> night boss (either he does the 'lights out' and is visible only by a small light everytime you reach an HP threshold or he makes the darkness and you can't enter it)

### Fourth level

### Fifth level
desert level - hydration mechanic which lowers the max jump limit - 

### Sixth level
test of the player's abilities - button (timed) sequence, jump puzzle, tongue mechanics - former biom seen in 0. level - HUMAN BOSS (child's father) - climb the human, environmental damage (hands) - different body sections, different gameplay gimmicks - final 'head' level - lick the eyes multiple times to kill it
