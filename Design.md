## Level design and chronology
### 0. level
    intro + sadfrog (TUTORIAL - ALL KEYS AND THEIR FUNCTION SHOULD BE DEMONSTRATED) - player jumps from a terrarium (which is out of sight *child noise?*)
### 1. level
    sandwich, flies -> flyking (shooting poops, increased fly spawn, player has to jump their way to flyking, when they damage him, he moves to the other side, when beat, )
### 2. level
    chase level - tsunami, if you are not fast enough, sandwich will be soaked - game over
### 3. level (night level)
    limited vision (circle around the player, that gets smaller) - when a player eats a firefly, the light radius expands -> night boss (either he does the 'lights out' and is visible only by a small light everytime you reach an HP threshold or he makes the darkness and you can't enter it) 
### 4. level
    frog hood - ranged enemies with AK47s - secret ending (read 'snoop frog')
### 5. level
    desert level - falling blocks mechanic - both an obstacle and a means to damaging the enemies
### 6. (final) level
    test of the player's abilities - button (timed) sequence, jump puzzle, tongue mechanics - former biom seen in 0. level - HUMAN BOSS (child's father) - climb the human, environmental damage (hands) - different body sections, different gameplay gimmicks - final 'head' level - lick the eyes multiple times to kill it

## Boss design and chronology
### 1. boss (Level 1) - Flyking
    Mood: The first bad guy, little hint of caricature, but still dramatic

    After killing XY flies that are at the end of the level, the visible screen ?ZOOMS OUT, LAYOUT OF THE ARENA CHANGES? and Flyking boss appears. It has no health, but there is a finite amount of hits it takes to defeat him. After each hit he moves to the opposite side of the arena. Depending on the position of the player the Flyking uses varying attacks:
        - lower part of the arena: Player-targeting poop shots
        -  middle part of the arena: Fly swarm sent from the position the Flyking is at
        - higher part of the arena: Poop shots to the ground below the player - the poop changes to a liquid that emits a smell cloud that gets to the higher part of the arena and functions like a DoT
        Flyking has 4 "HP" and loses one after being hit by the player. Each time flyking is hit, he changes in graphics to indicate that he is hurt.
### 2. boss (Level 2) - Tsunami
    Mood: Written in mood of the level
    
    Immortal, constantly moving giant wave that functions like a chase level mechanic. After nearing the end of the level there is a cutscene of the fake victory, but then the wave appears on the other side and chases the player back to the beginning of the level. Near the beginning there will be a platform that the player needs to reach and when he reaches it the game ends.
### 3. boss (Level 3) - Astro Firefly/Ghost Entity
    Mood: Mysterious, overwhelming
    
    The boss appears at the end of the level, where at this point you can clearly see the night sky. The main point of this boss are zodiac attacks that react to the night sky (Cancer - the boss walks backwards, Sagittarius - the boss shoots a projectile at a player etc). The entity has a set number of attacks it receives and reacts to the hit thresholds with unique attacks:
    Constellations that are used to the moveset of the boss is as follows:

        WIP!!!
        - 3. hit - Corvus - Boss flies up and makes a dive for the player
        - 6. hit - Sextans - A curve appears in the skies, after a while a damaging star flies to the ground. When the player collides with a star, he gets hit
        - 9. hit - Crater - Boss slams the ground and after an indicator appears he temporarily breaks the ground below the player, after a while the ground is "rebuilt"
        - 12. hit - Antlia - Boss drains the air out with an Antlia, which makes the player jump lower, after a while boss charges the player and afterwards gets back to his place
        - 15. hit - Hydra - *To be filled in*
    How to damage the boss: after using an XY amount of the same attack, the constellation that supported the attack will fall down and drop the stars to the arena. The player then needs to get to the stars and shoot them with their tongue to damage (hit) the boss. After this time window the boss changes the constellation and attacks again.
    Probably useful links for implementing stars and lightings mechanics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGFk44fY0O4, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWm5hi5Yrvk
### 4. boss (Level 5) - Olgoj Chorchoj
    Mood: Monsterous, mexican, desert
    After you will reach the open "desert" area, you will encounter an underground-moving worm boss. The boss will resurface after a visual and audio prompt and he will either:
    1) Summon enemies native to the level in a given patterns
    2) Shoot a sequence of projectiles at the player
    3) Confusing resurfacing - the boss resurfaces, but jebaits the player and burrows again
        There will be platforms that you can move to that will contain reappearing blocks that will fall after the player will stand on them for a longer period of time, they damage the boss.
### 5. boss (Level 6) - "Dad"
    Mood: Written in level's mood
    Voice-led level - the player is being chased by "dad" human. The level includes common enemies and moves normally, but in addition there are environmental attacks from the human (stomping, arm-swinging, slapping, whatever). After getting to a certain point in the level the player will be caught by a kid (cutscene plays where the frog gets back to the terrarium)
## Enemy design and their level assignment
### Has to be filled in
    Insert enemy info here

## NPC design and their level assignment
### NPC Black Rain Frog
    This frog will act for entertainment purposes in the cutscenes. In the beginning or during the story it will naturally frown to evoke sadness, in the end, it will finally smile.
    
## Decoration Blocks
Orobinec, listí, kapradí, zlomenej orobinec, přeslička, houby?, lopuch (možná spíš jako čepička k zakoupení)

## Easter eggs and secrets design
### Secret "Snoop Frogg" ending
    There are three options that can happen:
        Walk away - Continue as usual
        Smoke with Snoop - You ate the sandwich after having munchies - GAME OVER
