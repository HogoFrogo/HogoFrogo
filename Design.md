## Level design and chronology
### 0. level
    intro + sadfrog (TUTORIAL - ALL KEYS AND THEIR FUNCTION SHOULD BE DEMONSTRATED) - player jumps from a terrarium (which is out of sight *child noise?*)
### 1. level
    sandwich, flies -> flyking (shooting poops, increased fly spawn, player has to jump their way to flyking, when they damage him, he moves to the other side, when beat, )
### 2. level
    chase level - tsunami, if you are not fast enough, sandwich will be soaked - game over
### 3. level (night level)
    limited vision (circle around the player, that gets smaller) - when a player eats a firefly, the light radius expands -> night boss (either he does the 'lights out' and is visible only by a small light everytime you reach an HP threshold or he makes the darkness and you can't enter it) 
### 4. level
    frog hood - ranged enemies with AK47s - secret ending (read 'snoop frog')
### 5. level
    desert level - hydration mechanic which lowers the max jump limit - 
### 6. (final) level
    test of the player's abilities - button (timed) sequence, jump puzzle, tongue mechanics - former biom seen in 0. level - HUMAN BOSS (child's father) - climb the human, environmental damage (hands) - different body sections, different gameplay gimmicks - final 'head' level - lick the eyes multiple times to kill it
